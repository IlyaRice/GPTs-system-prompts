## Hacked ChatGPT GPTs Prompts Repository

Welcome! This repository is a trove of prompts from self-proclaimed 'unbreakable' GPTs from the OpenAI GPTs Store. I've managed to extract these prompts, demonstrating that security in the realm of GPTs can often be more of a challenge than a guarantee.

This collection serves as both a testament to the ingenuity required to navigate through the layers of protection and a resource for those curious about the potential weaknesses in their own GPTs. By exploring these examples, you'll gain insights into the complexity and nuances of prompt protection.

While I've developed highly effective, unique prompt-extraction techniques, I've chosen not to disclose these methods publicly to ensure broader security. My expertise in both uncovering and safeguarding GPT prompts is at your disposal. For those seeking consultations on prompt integrity and safety, I'm readily available for in-depth discussions.
